## Guidance

- Sound architecture, modern syntax, English-language comments
- Abstract the essence of problems, apply top-tier programmers' engineering mindset to analyze challenges, and identify optimal solutions and best practices
- Use an `interface` instead of a `type`
- Always run `pnpm lint` before committing
